# Timesheet
A basic python script that works from the command line to start/stop a timer by saving/retrieving the date to/from a data file.

# Usage
1. `python timesheet.py start`: starts the timer by saving the current time object to a file.  

2. `python timesheet.py stop`: stops counting the time by retrieving the previously saved time object from a file, and counting the difference to get the elapsed time.

# Prerequisite
**Dropbox-Uploader**: (https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader) To upload the timesheet to dropbox.
